todo:

translucent water (2 render calls for chunks containing water)

== next
fix pulp chunks
read settings from config file
first person (movement, jumping, collision detection)
shadow mapping
calculate vectors based on a reference region, not world center (remove any world center methods)

== backlog
refactor make file names use underscores
make region coordinate system is variable (not just 8-8-4)
put rendering and world loading on different threads
distant chunk rendering
infinite world depth
block deletion
inventory system
block addition
FPS counter
better spiral algorithm


BUG: water side textures...
Either:
- Ensure adjacent chunks must be generated before their meshes are built.
- Or, the meshbuilder must call getGenerateChunk from world, which will mean two things:
1. the world must be able to generate chunks
2. WorldSurfaceChunkGenerator must change...
