todo:

chunk column loading should start at the center of player
read settings from config file
block deletion
inventory system
block addition
first person (movement, jumping, collision detection)
translucent water (2 render calls for chunks containing water)
FPS counter
chunk model generation performance measurment and improvement
shadow mapping
make region coordinate system is variable (not just 8-8-4)
put rendering and world loading on different threads
distant chunk rendering
infinite world depth


BUG: water side textures...
Either:
- Ensure adjacent chunks must be generated before their meshes are built.
- Or, the meshbuilder must call getGenerateChunk from world, which will mean two things:
1. the world must be able to generate chunks
2. WorldSurfaceChunkGenerator must change...
